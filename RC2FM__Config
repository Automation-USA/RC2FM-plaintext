#Name:
RC2FM__Config
History:
Created by Automation USA - Julio Toledo
Last Modified: 7-3-2016
Purpose:
Initializes global variables that specify dynamic paths to fields, layouts, and table occurrences required by RC2FM
Parameters:
None
Important Notes:
We've made every effort to make the RC2FM integration as dyanmic and easily configurable as possible so it can be easily transferred to any FileMaker solution. However there are some script steps such as "Insert from URL" which require hard coded paths. Be sure to review all scripts when pasting/importing into your solution.
